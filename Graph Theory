We will add the following in graph theory:

1- Bellman Ford (with negative cylce detection)
2- Floyd Warshall algorithm
3- Dijkstra O(n^2) and O(n + m * log(n)) (min priority queue)
5- Topological sorting
6- LCA
7- Tarjan
8- Bridges and articulation points
9- Prim's algorithm O(n^2) and O(m log(n))
10- Kruskal's algorithm (with path compression + rank optimization)
11- Small to large trick

Flows:
1- Bipartite maximum matching / minimum vertex cover with dfs O(n*m)
2- Max Flow / Min Cut
